# Contributing to AFS-MappingXT

Thank you for considering contributing to AFS-MappingXT! This document outlines the process and guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Code Style

This project follows the **PSR-12: Extended Coding Style** standard. All code contributions must comply with this standard.

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. Before committing, check your code:
   ```bash
   composer test:style
   ```

See [CODE_STYLE.md](docs/CODE_STYLE.md) and [CODE_STYLE_QUICKSTART.md](docs/CODE_STYLE_QUICKSTART.md) for detailed information.

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** (if external contributor)
2. **Create a feature branch** from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test your changes**:
   - Run code style checks: `composer cs:check`
   - Fix style issues: `composer cs:fix`
   - Run static analysis: `composer stan`
5. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```
6. **Push to your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
7. **Create a Pull Request** to the `develop` branch

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Target branch**: Always create PRs against `develop`, not `main`
- **Description**: Provide a clear description of what changes you made and why
- **Testing**: Ensure all automated checks pass
- **Code style**: All code must pass PSR-12 checks
- **Documentation**: Update documentation if you change functionality
- **Commits**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages

## Code Quality Requirements

All pull requests must pass the following checks:

1. **PSR-12 compliance** (enforced by PHP_CodeSniffer)
2. **Static analysis** (enforced by PHPStan level 5)
3. **No syntax errors**
4. **Follows project conventions**

These checks run automatically via GitHub Actions when you create a PR.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear and descriptive commit messages:

### Format
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples
