# Security Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a configurable security mechanism for AFS-MappingXT that restricts direct access to `index.php` and `indexcli.php` when enabled.

## Problem Statement (Original)
> "es muss in der env noch festgelegt werden ob security on oder off sollte security auf on gestellt werden sollen die aufrufe der index.php oder indexcli.php nicht möglich sein es sei denn die aufrufe kommen aus der api"

Translation: "It must be defined in the env whether security should be on or off. If security is set to on, calls to index.php or indexcli.php should not be possible unless the calls come from the api."

## Solution Implemented

### Configuration
- Added `AFS_SECURITY_ENABLED` environment variable in `.env.example`
- Default value: `false` (no breaking changes to existing installations)
- Can be toggled via `.env` file or environment variables

### Security Validation Class
Created `SecurityValidator` class with three key methods:
1. `isSecurityEnabled()` - Checks if security mode is enabled in config
2. `isCalledFromApi()` - Uses PHP backtrace to detect if call originated from api/ directory
3. `validateAccess()` - Web/HTTP validation with HTML error page (HTTP 403)
4. `validateCliAccess()` - CLI validation with STDERR error output (exit code 1)

### Integration Points
1. **index.php**: Added security check after config load, before application logic
2. **indexcli.php**: Added security check after config load, before CLI processing
3. **config.php**: Added security configuration section
4. **autoload.php**: Added 'security' subdirectory to autoloader

### How It Works
```
When AFS_SECURITY_ENABLED=false:
  ✓ Direct browser access to index.php - ALLOWED
  ✓ Direct CLI access to indexcli.php - ALLOWED
  ✓ API-initiated access - ALLOWED

When AFS_SECURITY_ENABLED=true:
  ✗ Direct browser access to index.php - BLOCKED (HTTP 403)
  ✗ Direct CLI access to indexcli.php - BLOCKED (exit 1)
  ✓ API-initiated access - ALLOWED
```

### Detection Mechanism
Uses PHP's `debug_backtrace()` to inspect the call stack:
- Scans all stack frames for files in the `api/` directory
- Pattern: `/api/[^/]+\.php$`
- Reliable and cannot be spoofed by external requests
- Works in both HTTP and CLI contexts

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created `scripts/test_security_validator.php`:
- Tests class existence
- Tests security enabled/disabled detection
- Tests API call detection (direct vs. API-originated)
- Tests configuration reading
- **Result**: 6/6 tests pass ✅

### Integration Tests
Created `scripts/test_security_integration.php`:
- Tests index.php with security disabled
- Tests index.php with security enabled
- Tests API-initiated access
- Tests CLI security check
- **Result**: 4/4 tests pass ✅

### Syntax Validation
All PHP files pass syntax checks:
- ✅ classes/security/SecurityValidator.php
- ✅ index.php
- ✅ indexcli.php
- ✅ config.php

## Documentation

### Main Documentation
Created `docs/SECURITY_CONFIGURATION.md` covering:
- Configuration instructions
- How the mechanism works (with visual flow diagrams)
- Use cases (when to enable/disable)
- Error messages (browser and CLI)
- API integration details
- Testing procedures
- Implementation details
- Migration guide (no breaking changes)
- Security considerations and boundaries
- Troubleshooting guide
- Future enhancement ideas

### README Update
Updated main `README.md` to reference the new security feature in the security section.

## Code Quality

### Code Review
All code review feedback addressed:
- ✅ Enhanced use case descriptions for clarity
- ✅ Improved consistency by adding `validateCliAccess()` method
- ✅ Clarified security boundaries in documentation
- ✅ Explained what protections are outside scope

### Security Scan
- ✅ CodeQL checker: No vulnerabilities detected

## Files Changed

### New Files (8)
1. `classes/security/SecurityValidator.php` - Security validation class (119 lines)
2. `scripts/test_security_validator.php` - Unit tests (102 lines)
3. `scripts/test_security_integration.php` - Integration tests (76 lines)
4. `docs/SECURITY_CONFIGURATION.md` - Comprehensive documentation (363 lines)

### Modified Files (5)
1. `.env.example` - Added `AFS_SECURITY_ENABLED` configuration
2. `config.php` - Added security configuration section
3. `autoload.php` - Added 'security' to subdirectories array
4. `index.php` - Added `SecurityValidator::validateAccess()` call
5. `indexcli.php` - Added `SecurityValidator::validateCliAccess()` call
6. `README.md` - Updated security section

## Key Features

### Backward Compatible
- Default: security DISABLED
- No changes required for existing installations
- Opt-in feature for production environments

### Flexible
- Easy to enable/disable via environment variable
- Separate validation for web and CLI contexts
- Clear error messages in German (matching project language)

### Well-Tested
- 10 automated tests (all passing)
- Unit and integration test coverage
- Manual testing instructions provided

### Well-Documented
- 363-line comprehensive documentation
- Visual flow diagrams
- Use case examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Implementation details

## Usage Examples

### Enable Security
```bash
# Add to .env file
AFS_SECURITY_ENABLED=true

# Restart application/server
# Direct access will now be blocked
```

### Disable Security
```bash
# Add to .env file
AFS_SECURITY_ENABLED=false

# Or remove the line entirely (default is false)
```

### Test Security
```bash
# Run unit tests
php scripts/test_security_validator.php

# Run integration tests
php scripts/test_security_integration.php
```

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: Prevents unauthorized direct access to entry points
2. **API-Only Mode**: Forces all access through controlled API endpoints
3. **Production-Ready**: Designed for production environment security requirements
4. **Compliance**: Helps meet security policies requiring API-based access control
5. **Audit Trail**: API-based access can be logged and monitored
6. **Zero Impact**: Default disabled means no impact on existing installations

## Security Considerations

### Protected Against
- Direct access bypassing API authentication/authorization
- Uncontrolled access patterns
- Direct execution of management scripts

### Not Protected Against (By Design)
- API endpoint vulnerabilities (handled by API layer)
- SQL injection (handled by data layer)
- Network attacks (handled by infrastructure)
- Server misconfiguration (handled by ops)

These are intentionally outside the scope as they're handled by other system components.

## Conclusion

The security feature has been successfully implemented and fully tested. It provides a robust, configurable mechanism to restrict access to entry points while maintaining backward compatibility and ease of use. The implementation follows best practices with comprehensive testing and documentation.

## Commits

1. `25424ae` - Add security configuration to restrict access to index.php and indexcli.php
2. `f05e7ca` - Add comprehensive security documentation
3. `4dbf045` - Address code review feedback: improve consistency and documentation clarity

## Next Steps

For production deployment:
1. Add `AFS_SECURITY_ENABLED=true` to production `.env` file
2. Test access patterns (direct should be blocked, API should work)
3. Monitor logs for any unauthorized access attempts
4. Consider adding IP whitelisting at network level for additional security
